# CADTransformer: Panoptic Symbol Spotting Transformer for CAD Drawings
use symbolic graphic primitives to solve for CAD drawing symbol recognition.

## Main points / Summary
- Incorporate vector information (available as SVG file) as inputs for the CAD task.

## Key quotes 
- However, they formulate symbol spotting as symbol detection and simply treat vector CAD data as pixel images, leaving the gap between images and vector graphics and leading to inaccurate predictions for realworld applications.
