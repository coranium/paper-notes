# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation: A Review

Review paper for domain adaptation focusing on semantic segmentation applications. 

### Core problem formulation: 
1. deep learning (esp semantic segmentation) needs a lot of labelled data  
2. collecting and annotating is expensive, time consuming, error prone  
3. in many situations, we dont have sufficient training data for a certain task but there exists large amount of labelled data available for OTHER domains (similar to the one of interest) for certain reasons  
4. we want a way to utilize such 'other' data.

**Key points:**
- Adversarial learning
- generative based methods
- analysis of classifier discrepancies
- self teaching/ learning
- entropy minimisation
- curriculum learning
- multi-task learning
