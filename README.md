Insert introduciton here
This repo holds the notes for papers that I've read. Previously did this in a MS word document but that got too messy and slow when I needed to refer back. Still have yet to port over most of the past readings. Score is a number from (1) to (5) where 1 is just a quick skim through and 5 is complete understanding of the whole paper.
