Too many papers in DL/AI. Need some way to keep track of skimmed papers. Highlighting/annotating PDFs don't work too well for me so gonna try this.

This repo holds the notes for papers that I've read. Previously did this in a MS word document but that got too messy and slow when I needed to refer back. Still have yet to port over most of the past readings. Score is a number from (1) to (5) where 1 is just a quick skim through and 5 is complete understanding of the whole paper.

# Semi Supervised or Unsupervised learning

# Reinforcement Learning
Not really my focus but its a topic I find to be real cool. Somehow this is integrated with alot of DL work in general nowadays also, so better to know abit. Mainly will be reading articles or summaries by other people instead of the actual paper, just to get an intuitive idea and save time.
